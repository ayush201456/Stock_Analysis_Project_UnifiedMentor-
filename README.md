# 📈 Stock Market Analysis

Analyze historical stock prices from companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Netflix using Python and machine learning. This project focuses on predicting stock closing prices through data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, and regression modeling.

## 🚀 Features

* Clean and preprocess stock data
* Calculate Moving Averages (MA5, MA10) and Daily Returns
* Visualize closing price distribution and volume trends
* Train a Linear Regression model to predict closing prices
* Evaluate performance using R² Score and RMSE

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes historical stock records with the following columns:

* `Date`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`, `Ticker`

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* Python 3.x
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

## 💻 Installation

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## ▶️ How to Use

1. Open `stock_analysis.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells step by step
3. Review model predictions and visual insights

## 📊 Output

* Visuals: Histograms, scatter plots, company-wise volume charts
* Model: R² Score, RMSE, Actual vs Predicted closing prices
